## Installing the Project (and the User Interface)

First, you'll need to use git to clone the project repo:

Then, you'll need to move into the new directory and install the project's dependencies:
```Shell
cd CSC-4402-Group-Project
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
This imports SQLiteCpp version 3.1.1 from [here](https://github.com/SRombauts/SQLiteCpp/tree/sqlitecpp-release-3.3.1).

To quote the repo's description: "SQLiteC++ (SQLiteCpp) is a lean and easy to use C++ SQLite3 wrapper."

We used this wrapper to interact with our database in C++ and easily implement a proper user interface.

## Interacting with the User Interface

TODO: Add an explanation for how to use the UI.

## Running the Database

TODO: Add an explanation for how to use the database outside of the UI.

## Executing Test Queries on the Database

TODO: Add an explanation for how to execute test queries on the database.
